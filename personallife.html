                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>Scherzinger's early years in the Pussycat Dolls were marred with difficulties. During her first photo shoot with the group, she was required to wear nothing more than a bra, underwear and garters; uncomfortable with her own body she started to suffer from bulimia. In order to overcome her struggle with bulimia, she saw therapists and life coaches and recorded a PSA for the website Half of Us to raise awareness about the eating disorder. The eating disorder lasted for eight years, remarking that it would have destroyed her life.</p>
                <p>"I had started losing my voice, I couldn't sing at shows, and then I remember my manager finding me passed out on the floor in Malta or in the south of France. I thought, 'I'm going to lose everything I love if I don't love myself.' One day when you feel like you've reached the end, you just say, 'I'm not doing this anymore.' It's sad to see how I wasted my life. I had such a great life on the outside, the Dolls were on top of the world but I was miserable on the inside. I'm never letting that happen again; you only get one life – I was 27 only once."</p>

                <p>Scherzinger was engaged to Nick Hexum, lead singer of 311, whom she dated from 2000 to 2004. Scherzinger commenced a high-profile relationship with 6-time Formula 1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton after they met at the 2007 MTV Europe Music Awards in Munich.[173] Their on and off relationship of seven years was a tabloid fixture in the British press. They separated for the final time in February 2015. Since January 2020, she has been dating former Scottish rugby player Thom Evans.</p>
                
                <p>Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, along with various other artists, she was featured on the charity single "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", and participated in George Clooney's and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon which benefited people affected by the tragedy. In October 2010 she portrayed Trixie at the 35th anniversary concert of The Rocky Horror Picture Show which raised money for the Painted Turtle, a Hole in the Wall Foundation camp for kids with serious medical conditions. Inspired by her aunt who has Down syndrome, she became a global ambassador for the Special Olympics and recorded "O Holy Night" for A Very Special Christmas (2013) with all proceeds benefiting the organization. Since 2014 Scherzinger is an UNICEF UK supporter and has traveled to Guyana, Manila, Philippines, and Kenya, where she visited the organization's supported centers benefiting children in poverty.[181] She later performed "Brave" with the SU2C choir for Stand Up 2 Cancer to raise money for cancer research on October 17, 2014.</p>
